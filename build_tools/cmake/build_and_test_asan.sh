# Note: this script diverges from the non-ASan build in a few ways:
#   * The CMake build sets `IREE_ENABLE_ASAN=ON`
#   * Omit optional components that don't work with ASan (e.g. Python bindings)
#   * Some tests that fail under ASan are individually excluded
#
# The desired build directory can be passed as
# the first argument. Otherwise, it uses the environment variable
# IREE_ASAN_BUILD_DIR, defaulting to "build-asan". Designed for CI, but
# can be run manually. This reuses the build directory if it already exists.
#
# Build and test the project with CMake with ASan enabled and using
# SwiftShader's software Vulkan driver.
# ASan docs: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html
